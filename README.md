# Portfolio

The portfolio is a collection of work done to display skills learned in the area of Data Visualization and Analytics. The portfolio only included projects which could be displayed easily and therefore did not include many of the pure analytics or machine learning projects I have worked on.

### Software/Tools Used
- **Software**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS <br>
- **Tools**: VSCode <br>
